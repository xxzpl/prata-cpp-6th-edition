/*
    Design a structure called car that holds the following information about an automobile:
    its make, as a string in a character array or in a string object, and the year
    it was built, as an integer. Write a program that asks the user how many cars to catalog.
    The program should then use new to create a dynamic array of that many car structures.
    Next, it should prompt the user to input the make (which might consist of more than one word)
    and year information for each structure. Note that this requires some care
    because it alternates reading strings with numeric data (see Chapter 4).
    Finally, it should display the contents of each structure. A sample run should look
    something like the following:
        How many cars do you wish to catalog? 2
        Car #1:
        Please enter the make: Hudson Hornet
        Please enter the year made: 1952
        Car #2:
        Please enter the make: Kaiser
        Please enter the year made: 1951
        Here is your collection:
        1952 Hudson Hornet
        1951 Kaiser

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

    char make[50];
    int builtYear;
};

int main()
{
    cout << "How many cars do you wish to catalog? ";
    int numberOfCars = 0;
    (cin >> numberOfCars).get();
    Car * cars = new Car[numberOfCars];

    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfCars; i++)
    {
        cout << "Car #" << i + 1 << ":" << endl;
        cout << "Please enter the make: ";
        cin.getline(cars[i].make, sizeof(cars[i].make));
        cout << "Please enter the year made: ";
        (cin >> cars[i].builtYear).get();
    }

    cout << "Here is your collection:" << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfCars; i++)
    {
